# Subsequence Plus

Write music as Python code. Change it while it's playing.

Subsequence Plus is a MIDI sequencer you control from a Python script — or from a live coding environment where you can rewrite patterns, shift harmonies, and retune the tempo mid-performance without ever stopping playback.

```python
from subsequence_plus import Composition

composition = Composition(key="C", bpm=120)

@composition.pattern(channel=1, beats=4)
def bass(pattern, bar, beat):
    pattern.note(pitch=36, velocity=100, duration=1)
    pattern.note(pitch=43, velocity=80,  duration=0.5)

composition.web_ui()   # open the browser dashboard
composition.live()     # start the live coding server
composition.play()
```

---

## Installation

You'll need Python 3.10+ and a DAW or hardware synth receiving MIDI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThinkInSound/Subsequence-Plus.git
cd Subsequence-Plus
pip install -e .
```

> **Important:** use `git clone`, not the ZIP download. The ZIP is missing files that the installer needs.

**Windows users** — Subsequence Plus works on Windows. See the [Windows section](#windows) below.

### Optional extras

```bash
pip install aalink              # Ableton Link tempo sync
pip install mido python-rtmidi  # MIDI device selection in the Web UI
```

---

## The basics

### Patterns

A pattern is a function that gets called every time its loop comes around. Return notes by calling `pattern.note()`:

```python
@composition.pattern(channel=1, beats=2)
def kick(pattern, bar, beat):
    pattern.note(pitch=36, velocity=110, duration=0.1)
```

`beats` sets the loop length. `bar` and `beat` tell you where you are in the composition so you can vary things over time.

### Harmony

Tell Subsequence Plus what key and chord you're in and it will transpose your patterns automatically:

```python
composition.harmony(key="D", chord="minor7")
```

### Sections

Organise your piece into named sections with automatic transitions:

```python
composition.form([
    ("intro",  4),   # 4 bars
    ("verse",  8),
    ("chorus", 8),
])
```

---

## Live coding

The real power of Subsequence Plus is changing things while they play. Start the live coding server before `play()`:

```python
composition.live()     # starts a server on port 5555
composition.play()
```

Then from the **Web UI** (or any text editor that can open a socket) you can type Python and hit send — your changes take effect on the next bar:

```python
# change the tempo
composition.set_bpm(140)

# mute a pattern while you work on it
composition.mute("bass")

# redefine a pattern entirely
@composition.pattern(channel=1, beats=4)
def bass(pattern, bar, beat):
    pattern.note(pitch=33, velocity=90, duration=2)
```

---

## Web UI

The browser dashboard gives you a visual overview of everything happening in your composition and a built-in code editor for sending live changes.

```python
composition.web_ui()
composition.live()
composition.play()
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** in any browser.

### What's on screen

**Topbar**
- BPM display — drag up/down to change tempo, or tap the TAP button to set it by feel
- Bar and beat counters
- Current chord and key
- Link pill — shows Ableton Link status; click to toggle sync on/off
- Section progress bar

**Log tab** — everything you send to the REPL and every response comes back here in colour. There's also a quick command input at the bottom for one-liners without opening the editor.

**Signals tab** — live scrolling waveforms for any LFOs or values you've registered with the conductor. Useful for checking that modulations are doing what you expect.

**Patterns tab** — every running pattern listed with a mute button and a small 16-step grid showing which steps have notes and how loud they are.

**Prefs tab** — turn Ableton Link on or off, and select your MIDI input/output device if you need to switch without restarting.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Shift+Enter` | Send editor code to the live coding server |
| `Ctrl+↑` / `Ctrl+↓` | Step through previous commands |
| `Tab` | Indent (4 spaces) |

## Ableton Link

Link keeps Subsequence Plus's tempo locked to Ableton Live — and anything else on your network that supports Link (Ableton Live, Reason, Traktor, various iOS apps).

```bash
pip install aalink
```

That's it. If aalink is installed Subsequence Plus will connect to Link automatically when you call `play()`. You'll see the peer count in the Link pill in the Web UI.

- Change tempo in Ableton → Subsequence Plus follows
- Call `composition.set_bpm(140)` → Ableton follows
- Toggle sync on/off any time from the Prefs tab

---

## Windows

Subsequence Plus runs on Windows with two things to be aware of:

**1. Use git clone**
Download via `git clone` rather than the ZIP button on GitHub. The ZIP is missing the `.git` folder and the installer won't work without it.

**2. No extra steps needed for asyncio**
Older versions of Subsequence Plus crashed on Windows due to a signal handler that Windows doesn't support. This is fixed — it just works.

## Max for Live device

If you use Ableton Live you can add a small MIDI device to any track that shows whether Subsequence Plus is connected and lets you open the Web UI with one click.

The device files are in `tools/m4l/`:

**Setup (one time):**
1. In Ableton, drag a **Max MIDI Effect** onto a MIDI track
2. Click the pencil to open it in Max
3. Select everything in the patch and delete it
4. Open `subsequence_webui_PASTE.maxpat` in a text editor, copy everything, then go back to Max and choose **Edit → Paste from Clipboard**
5. Copy `subsequence.js` into the same folder as your saved `.amxd` file
6. First time only: click the `node.script` object and send it the message `script npm install ws`

The device connects automatically when Subsequence Plus is running and reconnects if it drops. You'll see a green LED when it's live and the current BPM ticking alongside it.

## API quick reference

| Call | What it does |
|---|---|
| `composition.play()` | Start everything — call this last |
| `composition.set_bpm(120)` | Change tempo; syncs to Link if connected |
| `composition.mute("name")` | Silence a pattern by name |
| `composition.unmute("name")` | Bring a pattern back |
| `composition.web_ui()` | Start the browser dashboard (port 8080) |
| `composition.live()` | Start the live coding server (port 5555) |
| `composition.form_next()` | Jump to the next section now |
| `composition.form_jump("chorus")` | Jump to a named section |
| `composition.harmony(key, chord)` | Change key and chord |
